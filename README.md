# Inda-Projekt - CampusGuessr
The aim of the follwing project is to create a browser-based geography game in which the player is tasked to guess the location of a certain photo depicted on a place on KTH campus. The player has to place their guess with a marker on an interactive map showcasing the campus. There will be 5 rounds where the scoring system will be based on length from actual placement with a maximum of 100 points. The distance will be calculated and saved until the last round. At the end, the results will be printed out in a readable way.

The aim of this project is to help new students get to know the campus in a fun and interactive way.

### Deadline
- Before the **Friday 26th of April** the Project Plan should be done (week 1).
- Before the Friday 3rd of May keep on developing (week 2).
- Before the **Friday 10th of May** have a somewhat working program that can be reviewed and presented. Usage of milestones, commits and issues will be taken into account (week 3).
- Before the **Friday 17th of May** the program should be done(week 4)! 

### Working process
The project will be divided into four weeks: planning week, developing week, reviewing week and fine-tuning week. In the beginning the focus will be on development of a working system and having a good working process, while later on finding bugs and fixing important details will probably be a priority.

### How to install/use project
Access to the project will likely be provided through a GitHub URL. Specific installation and usage instructions will be provided once finalized.
The website can be accessed here: https://gits-15.sys.kth.se/pages/lbenali/Inda-Projekt/

### Libraries
The Leaflet library will be utilized to create an interactive map within the game.

### Potential ideas to add
Here are some potential ideas to add in the future: 
- A highscore table (showing highest result for each photo where you can add you name), 
- Choosing difficulty meny,
- Different map modes (e.g satellite, hybrid and regular).
